Web Scraper Using R
Created an advanced web-scraping algorithm using R to extract crucial data from a specific URL, including Journal title, Authors, Affiliations, Correspondence, publish Date, and Abstract for over 500 journals resulting in a 90% increase in data accuracy.
Enhanced the efficiency of the web-scraping program by optimizing code structure and implementing parallel processing techniques, resulting in a 75% reduction in scraping time and improving overall productivity.
Collaborated with cross-functional teams to integrate the web-scraping program with existing database systems, enabling seamless storage and retrieval of journal information in real-time for improved decision-making processes.
